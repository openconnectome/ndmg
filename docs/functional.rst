Pipeline Summary

    Figure 1: The ``m2g-f`` organizes the data for processing by CPACâ€™s functional pipeline that we developed here. The ``m2g-f`` pipeline consists of 4 main steps: 1) preprocessing, 2) registration,  3) nuisance correction, and 4) graph generation. Each of these sections leverages publicely available tools and data to robustly produce the desired derivative of each step. Alongside derivative production, ``m2g-f`` produces QA figures at each stage that enable qualitative evaluation of the pipeline's performance.


------------
Preprocessing
------------

Registration in ``m2g`` leverages FSL and the Nilearn Python package. ``m2g`` uses linear registrations because non-linear methods had higher variability across studies and increased the time requirements of the pipeline dramatically.

The \texttt{m2g-f} pipeline in CPAC uses AFNI's SkullStripping function \cite{AFNI} with a variable shrink factor between 0.4 and 0.6 over 250 iterations with nearest neighbor interpolation to eliminate all non-neuronal structures from the anatomical image. The resulting anatomical file is resampled to the desired resolution voxel size using FSL's FNIRT \cite{fsl1, fsl2, fsl3}. Slice timing correction is then performed using AFNI's 3dTshift \cite{AFNI}, utilizing the TR value  and scan acquisition method provided by the user. The resulting image is then motion corrected using AFNI's 3dvolreg, aligning all images to the first image in the functional MRI's timeseries.

Finally, ``m2g`` produces a QA plot showing three slices of the first BO volume of the aligned dMRI image overlaid on the MNI152 template in the three principle coordinate planes (Figure S2).

    Figure S2: ``m2g-f`` **Registration QA**. ``m2g-f`` produces registration QA showing the zeroth slice of the dMRI sequence in green overlaid on the template brain in purple.

-----------------
Registration
-----------------

Nonlinear boundary based registration of the preprocessed fMRI and anatomical images are performed in order to transform them into MNI152 space. The MNI152 6th generation anatomical reference image \cite{mni152} is used in this registration process, as it is FSL's preferred image. The functional image is then registered to the anatomical scan using FSL bet \cite{fsl1, fsl2, fsl3} with BBR. FSL's standard white matter, grey matter, and cerebral spinal fluid masks are then registered onto the functional image using FSL's FAST thresholding, resulting in segmentation tissue masks. The specified atlases that are going to be used in the connectome generation are also registered to the functional space using FSL's FLIRT function.

    Figure S3: ``m2g-f`` **Tensor Estimation QA**. ``m2g-f`` produces tensor QA showing the voxelwise deterministic tensor model fit to the aligned dMRI sequence.

-----------------
Nuisance Correction
-----------------

``m2g`` uses DiPy's deterministic tractography algorithm, ``EuDX``. Integration of tensor estimation and tractography methods is minimally complex with this tractography method, as it has been designed to operate on the tensors produced by DiPy in the previous step. Probabilistic tractography would be significantly more computationally expensive, and it remains unclear how well it would perform on data with a small number of diffusion directions. The QA figure for tractography shows a subset of the resolved streamlines in an axial projection of the brain mask with the fibers contained therein (Figure S4). This QA figure allows the user to verify, for example, that streamlines are following expected patterns within the brain and do not leave the boundary of the mask.

-----------------
Graph Estimation
-----------------

With the anatomical files and atlases registered to the functional image, the estimation of the functional connectomes for each atlas can occur. For each ROI, the timeseries of the average of all voxels within the ROI at each collection time point is calculated. This timeseries is then used to calculate the Pearson's correlation coefficient \cite{pearson} between each pair of ROIs. The functional connectome is then rank-transformed by replacing the magnitude of the correlation with its relative rank, from smallest to largest \cite{discriminability}. The resulting adjacency matrix of correlations is then saved, along with an edgelist file containing the same information.


The connectomes generated are graph objects, with nodes in the graph representing regions of interest (ROIs) and edges representing connectivity via fibers. An undirected edge is added to the graph for each pair of ROIs a given streamline passes through. Edges are undirected because dMRI data lacks direction information. Edge weight is the number of streamlines which pass through a given pair of regions. ``m2g`` uses 24 parcellations, including all standard public dMRI parcellations known by the authors. Users may run ``m2g`` using any additional parcellation defined in MNI152 space simply by providing access to it on the command-line. To package an additional parcellation with ``m2g``, please contact the maintainers. The QA for graph generation depicts a number of graph statistics for each of the parcellation schemes. We typically generate this figure at the population level, as depicted in Figure S4.


Pipeline Outputs
================

The organization of the output files generated by the m2g-f pipeline are shown below. If you only care about the connectome edgelists (``m2g``'s fundamental output), you can find them in `/output/connectomes_f`. File labels that may appear on output files, these denote additional actions m2g may have done:

#. ``RAS`` = File was originally in RAS orientation, so no reorientation was necessary
#. ``reor_RAS`` = File has been reoriented into RAS+ orientation
#. ``nores`` = File originally had the desired voxel size specified by the user (default 2mmx2mmx2mm), resulting in no reslicing
#. ``res`` = The file has been resliced to the desired voxel size specified by the user
