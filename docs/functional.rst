Pipeline Summary

    Figure 1: The ``m2g-f`` organizes the data for processing by CPACâ€™s functional pipeline that we developed here. The ``m2g-f`` pipeline consists of 4 main steps: 1) preprocessing, 2) registration,  3) nuisance correction, and 4) graph generation. Each of these sections leverages publicely available tools and data to robustly produce the desired derivative of each step. Alongside derivative production, ``m2g-f`` produces QA figures at each stage that enable qualitative evaluation of the pipeline's performance.


-------------
Preprocessing
-------------

The ``m2g-f`` pipeline in CPAC uses AFNI's SkullStripping function with a variable shrink factor between 0.4 and 0.6 over 250 iterations with nearest neighbor interpolation to eliminate all non-neuronal structures from the anatomical image. The resulting anatomical file is resampled to the desired resolution voxel size using FSL's FNIRT. Slice timing correction is then performed using AFNI's 3dTshift, utilizing the TR value and scan acquisition method provided by the user. The resulting image is then motion corrected using AFNI's 3dvolreg, aligning all images to the first image in the functional MRI's timeseries.

Finally, ``m2g`` produces a QA plot showing the stripped image overlayed with the removed skull (Figure S2).

-----------------
Registration
-----------------

Nonlinear boundary based registration of the preprocessed fMRI and anatomical images are performed in order to transform them into MNI152 space. The MNI152 6th generation anatomical reference image  is used in this registration process, as it is FSL's preferred image. The functional image is then registered to the anatomical scan using FSL ``bet`` with BBR. FSL's standard white matter, grey matter, and cerebral spinal fluid masks are then registered onto the functional image using FSL's ``FAST`` thresholding, resulting in segmentation tissue masks. The specified atlases that are going to be used in the connectome generation are also registered to the functional space using FSL's ``FLIRT ``function.


-------------------
Nuisance Correction
-------------------

Nuisance correction of the functional image is performed using the component based noise correction (``CompCor``) method. Using ''noise ROIs'', or areas of white matter and cerebral spinal fluid whose intensity values are unlikely to be modulated by neural activity, physiological noise can be isolated.Based on this assumption, physiological noise in gray matter regions can be corrected for by regressing out principal components from noise ROIs. CompCor uses the previously registered white matter and cerebral spinal fluid masks (csf) in order to determine noise ROIs. A principal component analysis is applied using the top five components of the white matter and csf to characterize the times series data from the noise ROIs. Significant principal components are then introduced as covariates in a general linear model as an estimate for the physiological noise single space. Polynomial Detrending is also performed to remove linear or quadratic trends in the timeseries, likely from changes in scanner heat or subject movement. After nuisance regression, frequency filtering occurs on the functional data using a bandpass filter from 0.01 Hz to 0.1 Hz to account for low-frequency drift and high-frequency noise.

Finally, ``m2g`` produces a QA plot showing the plots for translation and rotation correction of the functional images (Figure S3).

-----------------
Graph Estimation
-----------------

With the anatomical files and atlases registered to the functional image, the estimation of the functional connectomes for each atlas can occur. For each ROI, the timeseries of the average of all voxels within the ROI at each collection time point is calculated. This timeseries is then used to calculate the Pearson's correlation coefficient  between each pair of ROIs. The functional connectome is then rank-transformed by replacing the magnitude of the correlation with its relative rank, from smallest to largest. The resulting adjacency matrix of correlations is then saved, along with an edgelist file containing the same information.


Pipeline Outputs
================

The organization of the output files generated by the m2g-f pipeline are shown below. If you only care about the connectome edgelists (``m2g``'s fundamental output), you can find them in `/output/connectomes_f`. File labels that may appear on output files, these denote additional actions m2g may have done:

#. ``RAS`` = File was originally in RAS orientation, so no reorientation was necessary
#. ``reor_RAS`` = File has been reoriented into RAS+ orientation
#. ``nores`` = File originally had the desired voxel size specified by the user (default 2mmx2mmx2mm), resulting in no reslicing
#. ``res`` = The file has been resliced to the desired voxel size specified by the user
