Here we discuss the CPAC implementation of the m2g-f pipeline.

Output Summary Table
====================

The organization of the output files generated by the m2g-f pipeline are shown below. If you only care about the connectome edgelists (**m2g**'s fundamental output), you can find them in `/output/connectomes_f`.

File labels that may appear on output files, these denote additional actions m2g may have done:

#. RAS = File was originally in RAS orientation, so no reorientation was necessary
#. reor_RAS = File has been reoriented into RAS+ orientation
#. nores = File originally had the desired voxel size specified by the user (default 2mmx2mmx2mm), resulting in no reslicing
#. res = The file has been resliced to the desired voxel size specified by the user
