Overview of m2g
================================

NeuroData’s MR Graphs package, `m2g`, is the successor of the MRCAP, MIGRAINE, and m2g pipelines. m2g combines dMRI, fMRI, and sMRI data from a single subject to estimate a high-level connectome reliably and scalably.

The m2g pipeline has been developed as a one-click solution for human connectome estimation by providing robust and reliable estimates of connectivity across a wide range of datasets. The pipelines are explained and derivatives analyzed in our pre-print, available on BioRxiv_.
