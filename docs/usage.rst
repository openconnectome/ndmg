In order to share data between our container and the rest of our machine in Docker, we need to mount a volume.
Docker does this with the -v flag. Docker expects its input formatted as: ``-v path/to/local/data:/path/in/container``.
We'll do this when we launch our container, as well as give it a helpful name so we can locate it later on.

The ``neurodata/m2g`` Docker container enables users to run end-to-end connectome estimation on structural MRI or functional MRI right from container launch. The pipeline requires that data be organized in accordance with the BIDS spec. If the data you wish to process is available on S3 you simply need to provide your s3 credentials at build time and the pipeline will auto-retrieve your data for processing.

If you have never used Docker before, it is useful to run through the Docker documentation_.

**Getting Docker container**::

    $ docker pull neurodata/m2g

Structural Connectome Pipeline (`m2g-d`)
----------------------------------------

The structural connectome pipeline can be ran with::

    $ m2g --pipeline dwi <input_directory> <output_directory>

We recommend specifying an atlas and lowering the default seed density on test runs (although, for real runs, we recommend using the default seeding -- lowering seeding simply decreases runtime)::

    $ m2g --pipeline dwi --seeds 1 --parcellation Desikan <input_directory> <output_directory>

You can set a particular scan and session as well (recommended for batch scripts)::

    $ m2g --pipeline dwi --seeds 1 --parcellation Desikan --participant_label <label> --session_label <label> <input_directory> <output_directory>


Functional Connectome Pipeline (`m2g-f`)
----------------------------------------

The functional connectome pipeline can be ran with::

    $ m2g --pipeline func <input_directory> <output_directory>

or::

    $ m2g --pipeline func --parcellation Desikan <input_directory> <output_directory>

You can set a particular scan and session as well (recommended for batch scripts)::

    $ m2g --pipeline func --parcellation Desikan --participant_label <label> --session_label <label> <input_directory> <output_directory>


Running both `m2g-d` and `m2g-f`
--------------------------------

Both pipelines can be run by setting the `pipeline` parameter to `both`::

    $ m2g --pipeline both <input_directory> <output_directory>


Demo
=====

To install and run a tutorial of the latest Docker image of m2g, pull the docker image from DockerHub using the following command. Then enter it using `docker run`::

    $ docker pull neurodata/m2g:latest
    $ docker run -ti --entrypoint /bin/bash neurodata/m2g:latest

Once inside of the Docker container, download a tutorial dataset of fMRI and diffusion MRI data from the `open-neurodata <https://registry.opendata.aws/open-neurodata/>`_` AWS S3 bucket to the `/input` directory in your container (make sure you are connected to the internet)::

    $ aws s3 sync --no-sign-request s3://open-neurodata/m2g/TUTORIAL /input

Now you can run the `m2g` pipeline for both the functional and diffusion MRI data using the command below. The number of `seeds` is intentionally set lower than recommended, along with a larger than recommended `voxelsize` for a faster run time (approximately 25 minutes). For more information as to what these input arguments represent, see the Tutorial section below.::

    $ m2g --participant_label 0025864 --session_label 1 --parcellation AAL_ --pipeline both --seeds 1 --voxelsize 4mm /input /output

Once the pipeline is done running, the resulting outputs can be found in `/output/sub-0025864/ses-1/`, see Outputs section below for a description of each file.



Working with S3 Datasets
========================

**m2g** has the ability to work on datasets stored on [Amazon's Simple Storage Service](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), assuming they are in BIDS format. Doing so requires you to set your AWS credentials and read the related s3 bucket documentation. You can find a guide [here](https://github.com/neurodata/m2g/blob/deploy/tutorials/Batch.ipynb).


Example Datasets
----------------

Derivatives have been produced on a variety of datasets, all of which are made available on [our website](http://m2g.io). Each of these datsets is available for access and download from their respective sources. Alternatively, example datasets on the [BIDS website](http://bids.neuroimaging.io) which contain diffusion data can be used and have been tested; `ds114`, for example.


Command-Line Arguments
======================

Below is the help output generated by running **m2g** with the ``-h`` command. All parameters are explained in this output. ::

    $ docker run -ti neurodata/m2g -h
